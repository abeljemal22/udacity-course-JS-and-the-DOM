Loading the Web Page

Tips for Using the Workspace
Open the workspace in a new tab and keep it open while you work your way through the course. You'll want to go back and forth between the workspace and the classroom.
Expand the workspace to full screen. That will give you more room to work.
If the type in the workspace is too small, use your browser's zoom control to magnify the screen.
You can upload files to the workspace by dragging and dropping them into the workspace window.
You can download files from the workspace by right-clicking on the file in the Explorer panel and selecting Download.
